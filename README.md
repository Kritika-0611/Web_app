In this project, we analyze historical Olympic data using Python for insights and predictions. The analysis is focused on identifying trends in medal distribution, athlete performance, country-specific results, and event-wise participation. The entire analysis is made interactive and accessible through a Streamlit web app.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize medal tallies over different years and countries.
Analyze athlete performance based on age, gender, and participation in different sports.
Identify top-performing countries and events over time.

Streamlit Deployment:

Streamlit is used to build an interactive web interface, allowing users to:
Explore medal tally data with filtering options by year or country.
View dynamic visualizations of athlete and country performances.
Compare countries or athletes based on historical data.
Access predictions for future Olympic medal distributions.
Deployment: The app can be hosted on Streamlit Cloud or other hosting platforms for easy access and interaction.
This project delivers a comprehensive analysis of Olympic data, made accessible and interactive through a user-friendly web app powered by Streamlit.
